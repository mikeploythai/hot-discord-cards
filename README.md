###### WHAT IS THIS?

Hot Discord Cards (working title) is a web platform developed by [Mike Ploythai](https://github.com/mploythai) and [Shaleen Mathur](https://github.com/shaleen23) for our Software Engineering course at Cal State Fullerton.

The idea stemmed from the desire to create an interactive app that revolved around our friends, hence why we refer to this project as a _love letter to our friends_. As development continued, the idea evolved into a platform where users can earn points, and use those points to unlock cards at random. These cards represent our friends in funny ways, and can be traded with other users.

The purpose of this project is just to get a laugh out of our friends, and to show the gratitude we have towards them.
